- **Excel** (cross-checking summaries)  
- **Power BI** (optional – extended visuals)  

---

## 📌 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Standardized categorical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, distributions)  
   - Trends across time, sports, and countries  

3. **Visualization**
   - Medal trends, athlete demographics, gender distribution  
   - Height/Weight histograms  
   - Correlation analysis  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Medal Leaders:** USA & USSR dominate overall medal counts  
- **Participation Growth:** Steady rise in athletes & countries, especially after 1950  
- **Gender Equality:** Female participation has grown significantly post-1980s  
- **Athlete Profiles:** Sports show clear physique requirements  
  - Basketball players → taller & heavier  
  - Gymnasts → shorter & lighter  
- **Sport Popularity:** Athletics & Swimming consistently yield the most medals
